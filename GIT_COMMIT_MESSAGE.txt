Frontend (React):
- CV Builder component
- Template selector
- Live preview
- Export options
- Public profile viewer

Database:
- CVs table
- CVVersion (history)
- CVExport (tracking)
- Analytics

Timeline:
=========

Week 1: Templates integration (9 LaTeX + HTML)
Week 2: Parsers integration (JSON Resume CLI)
Week 3: Backend APIs (Controllers, Services)
Week 4: Frontend (Components, Integration)
Week 5: Testing & Deployment

Total: 4-5 weeks

Dependencies:
=============

NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Zod, Puppeteer, Handlebars,
TypeScript, React, Vite, Tailwind, Jest, Supertest

No Breaking Changes:
====================

✅ Job Publisher System - unchanged
✅ Matches System - unchanged
✅ Admin Panel - unchanged
✅ User Authentication - enhanced
✅ Database - extended (new tables only)

Security:
=========

✅ Input validation everywhere
✅ JWT authentication
✅ HTTPS enforced
✅ XSS prevention
✅ SQL injection prevention
✅ CSRF protection
✅ Rate limiting (optional)

Next Steps:

2. Approve the strategy
3. Setup environment
4. Start implementation (Week 1)
5. Follow the technical guide
6. Run comprehensive tests
7. Deploy to production
