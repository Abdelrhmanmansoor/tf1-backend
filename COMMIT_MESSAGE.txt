Fix: Correct module imports and method calls in applicationController

- Fixed duplicate 'Application' prefix in import variable names (lines 4-5)
- Corrected import paths to Conversation.js and Message.js
- Fixed static method call from createApplicationConversation to createConversation (lines 67, 120)
- Fixed instance method call from updateLastApplicationMessage to updateLastMessage (line 137)

Root Cause:
The deployment was failing with "Cannot find module ApplicationConversation" because:
1. Import paths pointed to non-existent files (ApplicationConversation.js, ApplicationMessage.js)
2. Actual files are Conversation.js and Message.js
3. These files export as ApplicationConversation and ApplicationMessage models
4. Method names were incorrect (createApplicationConversation vs createConversation)

Impact:
- Fixes backend deployment error (exit code 1 on Render)
- Enables application status update functionality
- Enables automatic conversation creation on 'interviewed' status
- No breaking changes to API or frontend

Files Changed:
- src/modules/job-publisher/controllers/applicationController.js (6 lines)

Testing:
- Verified model exports in Conversation.js and Message.js
- Verified static method name is createConversation
- Verified instance method name is updateLastMessage
- No migration required
- Frontend remains compatible
